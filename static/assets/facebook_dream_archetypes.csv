"I was house sitting for a family member. I walked to the house, which was actually a long walk, along a dirt path. Ahead of me was a deer chasing a grizzly bear. My walking speed matched their running speed. I entered the house and started turning on lights as it was getting dark quickly. I went to the back door to find a black bear napping in what looked like a large mud room. The pets inside the house were all panicking. I tried to secure the house but the black bear found a way in through a door I didn't know about. I ran to the basement to find several family members watching television. When I told them a bear was in the house they panicked. I went back upstairs, grabbed the bear by the scruff of his neck and dragged it outside.",hero
"I'm driving a car in a world I am familiar with, it's a video game world, more specifically the Grand Theft Auto world. (I’ve never really played the game by the way, IF I played it, my time was spent driving around legally, not even speeding. So it’s safe to say I haven’t really played it) I realize the cops are chasing me, no small amount of cops, cars and policemen on foot. I'm an evil man (woman in real life btw which is interesting as well), a criminal. I drive fast and recklessly and I’m running through several doors, up and down stairs….Soon I've gotten rid of the cops, they're not after me anymore. I'm in an empty house that’s still being built, it’s basically still just an iron structure (similar to the one in The Dark Knight when Batman and Joker battle)…I'm not alone, Aragorn (Lord of the Rings) is there fighting me and he has a sword, I also have a sword. We are hanging on iron pillars and fencing. I get a hold of his sword and I kick him off the building, I watch him fall while I hang there. When he hits the ground I look up at the building, there I see millions of faces / heads on the building - like manikin heads. I instantly know it’s me, my face, but instead of it being my own real life face, I'm the Joker (Joker 2020 version) with a disgusting grin on its face. ;  Background_Info: Most times when I have a nightmare I am running away from evil, or in some other way trying to escape evil. This time I was evil running away from heroes. I loved the Joker 2020 movie. ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###",jester
"I was in a huge house with a bunch of friends, some of whom I recognized. It was pretty obvious that we were there to party and it seemed like a cabin in the woods. At one point, we talk about going onto the roof and the staircase is a spiral going up at least 10 floors on the outside. One of the women seems to speed up it like sonic the hedgehog in front of me. On the roof, it’s obvious we are in a mountain town and it’s lit with string lights and super pretty. An old man comes up from what seems to be a ladder on the side of the building on the other side from us and he motions to us saying something like, hey is this yours? He seems like a grounds keeper or building manager. We walk over and there’s a few benches with towels and unwrapped (but really neatly laid) condoms on them. I said something like “no, that must have been the people here before us?” And I had this grossed out feeling. He acts a bit funny about it, seems to be mad at us and then leaves. We keep talking and then he appears again right in front of us coming over onto the roof but this time he seems like he’s turned into an alien with a squid-like face. One of the guy leans down towards him and all of a sudden I become the alien and I shoot my tentacles at his mouth, punch a hole I. The back of his head and rip his mouth off to where there’s just a gaping black hole where it used to be but no blood. ;  Background_Info: Overall I only have wild, violent dreams and stopped dreaming for years until I read Alchemy: an introduction to the symbolism and psychology. I often feel I’m half awake and just following the journey and don’t wake up anxious or stressed, usually just super weirded out. ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###",explorer
"In my dream I saw a blonde girl. She was cute; not the most attractive person, but for some reason she appealed to me more than many beauties. She was dressed in a very simple way, her clothes were light blue and pink. She was a magician. She invited me to join a club she belonged to herself. In this club magicians could meet, talk, spend time together. I was tempted to join, but I was not ready to commit myself, because that would mean I'd have to attend the first meeting immediately, so I just said I would consider it for next time. She was slightly disappointed.",wizard
"I visit the town and I walk along the street with someone Idk (but do in this dream). I realise something is wrong and that all of the shops now have weird names. Still their names but either with a night/dream pun or some night/dream logo. The person idk (Let’s call him P, I guess) sat on a bench and I ask them wth is going on, they confirm it was my town but that it’s called Whoville now. Very confused, we walk into this shop. The manager is walking around shouting ‘Make sure […] don’t fall asleep in my shop!’. Some guy looks drunk and as if he’s going to fall asleep. P helps him out of the shop and he’s grateful. Soon after, the shops begin to close and the place looks dark and gloomy. All the shops looked as if they were abandoned. Broken windows, lights, and cafés had food laying around. People walking around went into different shops. A group of women were in this café next to me and began eating. Quickly, they all collapsed. P complains that this is just like ‘so and so shop’ and that people just shouldn’t take the risk anymore! I quickly realised that they were all dead. (For some reason) I and P break the windows of a real estate shop and see this very old, short man with black hair and small glasses. He wore old fashioned but fancy clothes. We talk to him for a bit, ask him questions etc. Turns out that you can either leave your shop in view or hide it. If you leave it in view you can leave a light on to let people know […]. He said that it was stupid and he would never do that. He continues to talk and I look over to see candles lit at a window. I quickly blew them out so that he wouldn’t notice. They came back. I repeated this until I ran to a lever that hid the shop. All of the windows were now gone, replaced by wood. The man ran out back and we followed. (Idk what happened next) ((THIS IS THE PART I REMEMBER DREAMING ABOUT BEFORE)) He gives in and starts talking about the town and his childhood. Under this shop, there was a huge cavern. As a kid, he and some townsfolk went down there (for some reason). All of a sudden, he found this girl around his age. She wore a gorgeous blue dress and bonnet with white trim. They talked and talked and they had a great time. The town and he all had to escape the cavern and he begged the girl to come. He dragged her up all the scaffolding with the town. Just as they reached the door back into the shop, part of the scaffolding was gone. The town (already on the other side) tried to help but there wasn’t much they could do. He held onto her and she begged him to leave her here and he jumped successfully to the door. He said ‘We made it!’. But then the girl, still in his arms, said that she wasn’t finished here yet and like a snake slithered out of his arms and fell back into the cavern. The man said that he had stayed there for years hoping to finally be able to save that girl. I and P both nodded toward each other and we went out the back door and began our climb down into the cavern, the man not far behind us. With our flashlights, we looked around for ages. Eventually, we found the girl who wore the same blue dress. The man was ecstatic and began to talk to her. All was well until all of a sudden she began to transform into this huge snake-like creature (with small legs and she was still wearing the dress). (I don’t remember why but) She began to attack us. Quickly, we ran back up the scaffolding and into the shop. She slithered her way up and partially through the door. ;  Background_Info: I’ve had this dream before. It probably isn’t exactly the same but it’s still the same dream. ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###",everyman
"I was 17-18 so about 15-16 years ago. One of my best friends and I were walking on a plato along the ocean the plato was orangish redish like the Grand Canyon colorful flowers beautiful clear sky the ocean was calm and crystal clear you could easily see all the coral and tropical fish even though the table of the plato was a good way above the water, basically imagin the most beautiful ocean seen you possibly could. So my friend and I are walking smoking a joint and talking “can’t remember a thing about the conversation” anyway I decide I’m jumping off the plato and tell my buddy he agrees it’s the right thing to do so we jump. It was as amazing as I thought it would be everything was so pretty. Then a dolphin swam close to us and let us pet it I decided I’m riding this damn thing so I grab it’s top fin and away we go he took me all over showing me all the beautiful things it was great I was having such a good time after a while I thought man I’m hogging the dolphin Marky needs to do this too so we go back to my friend and I let him have a turn. That’s when it went down I guess the dolphin didn’t like my buddy cause he started ramming him knocking him out of the water and there’s nothing I can do I have no weapon and you can’t fight a dolphin in water with no weapon and win so I’m terrified my buddies limp body just getting thrashed and nothing I can do about it then I woke up. So it went from probably the best dream I’ve ever had directly into one of the scariest dreams I’ve ever had.",creator
"Came to discover that I was being asked to participate in a wedding, and I came to find out that it was my wife, or someone like her, getting married at the church my ex-wife and I used to attend. There was an apartment full of my ex-wife and her siblings, but they weren’t her real siblings. They were in the process of moving out of the apartment. I was there, frantically going from person to person, trying to figure out what was going on. It seemed to everyone like the most natural thing in the world, and my vehement protest was viewed as outlandish and inappropriate. I was distraught and desperately tried to make them see. “What is going on!?” Then I was riding a horse through a sort of natural area, a national park. I saw that some belts had been discarded. I picked one up like a whip. I rode my horse downhill. It was hilly country, with grass and water and a view of a far distant country at a lower elevation. Then I was back at the apartment. There was a Asian person there, of ambiguous gender. I asked this person to come back to the bedroom with the aim of seducing them. They didn’t know what I wanted and they got uncomfortable and finally said “oh, for some reason I thought you wanted to...” then my ex-wife’s sister came back (but not the real one) and we looked out the back window to see that there was a small prototype fighter jet being worked on by a couple of people, a woman and some children. “Jet fuel?” I asked. “That would be your low-grade test fuel,” the sister replied matter-of-factly.",lover
I dreamed about my dad giving me a ride to my doctors appointment. The time was 2:08PM. We saw red lights flashing at the railroad crossing. Dad stopped at the railroad crossing and waited for the train. We looked left and right to see if the freight train was approaching. Dad thought about going through. He did a U-Turn and went a different direction to the doctors office. We arrived at the doctors office. Dad walked ahead of me upstairs to the doctors office. I lost sight of him. I ran up the first flight of stairs then I heard footsteps thinking it was my dad walking up the steps but it was someone else. When I was about halfway up the steps I heard them announce my name on the Public Announcement System. I reached the 3rd floor where the doctors office was located I saw old clients sitting in their chairs.,hero
"I dream that I’m back in my childhood bedroom. It’s not the only bedroom I had in childhood, but it is the one in the home we shared with him, and the room I had through my most formative years. The room is barren, but I’m painting it a baby blue color. Suddenly I notice he’s in the room with me; I’m not sure when he came in, but when I turn around he’s painting over my blue with a dark red. I start screaming “Stop! Can’t you see I’m trying to paint it blue? Why can’t you see that? Stop!” He ignores me, and suddenly the bat I used to play softball with in the time I lived there is in my hands. I start hitting him with it, and I’m crying and saying “Please stop painting it red, I’m trying to paint it blue.” I can feel the resistance of my bat hitting him, I’m swinging as hard as I can, but I never see it hurting him. He continues to standing facing away from me as I hit him. ;  Background_Info:  I have a reoccurring dream about the man who used to molest me as a teenager and I need help to understand what it means, I feel like there has to be a reason I keep having it. ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###",everyman
In my dream I wake up and go to my son to get him out of his crib and he has scratches all over his tummy and back and I freak out send a video to my hubby .I go sit on the bed with him and I remember just being so scared in the room. We wind up at some hotel and it’s me and my sisters and hubby and we all just hanging out and I ask him if he has watched the video he hasn’t that he left his phone and I tell him about it and he doest take it serious so I try to leave and I’m in the parking lot and my car is next to another vehicle and it has a walker in between it I assume it was my great grandma because she used a walker ( she has recently passed). I open the door slightly and turn the key and then go to passenger side to get in when I noticed my fiancé turn off the car and say your not leaving . Some more stuff happened the scene changed I was at my grandma house in the backyard and the fish was jumping out the water. ;  Background_Info: So I have weird dreams quite often and they are usually very vivid.  Backstory I don’t know if this could be related to the dream so my son (toddler) has and random scratches on him could be from himself through the night we recently changed diapers due to saving money and we noticed during the day he would scratch his back area where the diaper was. he sometimes has scratches on his head or other places. We have changed back diapers now to see if the diaper was the problem he also has a form of eczema so he has itchy skin at times . I told my husband it freaks me out cause my mom brain over thinks and since he wakes up with them in the morning I think what if a ghost or something. My husband reassures me there is no ghost .   I often dream about the pond of my grandparents backyard but I don’t think it has to much meaning in this dream.  ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###,everyman
"I'm planting potatoes. It seems to be nighttime. I feel lightheaded so I sit down then lay down on the ground. There are other people around. A short older man sees that I need help but thinks I need help getting back up whereas I just need to lay there for a minute so I don't faint. He squeezes me around the chest to try to support me. At first I pretend to accept his help to be nice and start to sit up, but the squeezing makes me feel more lightheaded and I panic thinking I will faint and yell ""Let go! Let go! Let go!"" Or something like that. The man releases his grip immediately but it doesn't seem fast enough. I am still planting potatoes but now it is day time and I'm just with my mom. I am in the process of planting the potatoes at the ends of a row of garden beds. It occurs to me that I hadn't asked my mom if this is okay and they are her garden beds. I ask her and she says it's fine and I can plant them wherever there is room. She asks me how many pounds of potatoes I had grown last year. I said I didn't know because I hadn't weighed them because I remembered I hadn't harvested them all at once but little by little as I thought they were ready. In the dream this seems to be the third year in a row I have planted potatoes.""",everyman
"Some people were torturing a Bison. The animal had its legs tied together and was hanging by its legs so it couldn't defend itself. The primary abuser was a young woman who seemed to be trying to be exceptionally cruel to impress the men, like to show how tough she was. I was witnessing the scene but not in it. I felt shocked and horrified at what I was seeing. Then it was like I was reading about this in a book and I skipped forward in the book to try to get past the torture scene, but landed right at the part where the young woman killed the Bison. She killed it with some metal device that punched a hole in its skull and scrambled its brains.",rebel
I was going to a hair appointment with two friends and I let one drive my car. The car was white with black specks all over it. We arrived at the place and my aunt was there. We let one friend out and we went to park and once we did I got out of the car and couldn’t see because the sun was so bright. I went back for my sunglasses but my friend and my car was gone. I woke up briefly and fell back asleep only to continue the dream. I tried to make it over to my aunt but the place changed and I was wearing some type of mask and couldn’t see well. I also heard some strange music. At some point I had a different phone that I knew wasn’t mine and I didn’t know how to use it.

"I was a fish, I was lost in the sewers, and I was guided by another fish, I believe. I could hear its voice. It led me trough the dirty water, towards the ocean. As we progressed the water got clearer and clearer. I wanted to go back to the human world. I wanted to be human again, to taste human food again and live the joys of being human. Once we managed to emerge in the ocean, it was great. We swam near the surface. The other fish told me: ""now, if you want to go back, fishermen will arrive soon. Just let yourself be captured, it will be quick and you will be reborn in no time."" I felt uneasy. The idea of dying was not so great, after all. I tried to get as far away from the fishermen as possible. I was afraid, because I realized even if I were to die, who can guarantee i will be reborn human, and not a puma, bear or another unfortunate animal?",explorer
"There was a male individual that was ousted from my family for something he didn't do. Rather than siding with my family on this one I believed in him as I knew he could never have done what he was being accused of. At some point, things escalated where my family was planning to chase him away, so the both of us left. We ended up splitting when we left and I somehow ended up in my dad's apartment. No one was present but his wife, and there was a Golden Retriever there. He was filthy, and as I tried to hose him down I could see all the dirt and grime coming off of him. I thought there was no way I could let him stay there. Well, I happened to look around and also saw there was a baby, and the baby needed it's diaper changed. That's when my dads wife came in and I became angry, telling her I was going to take the baby as it was obvious she was unfit to take care of her. She was pretty calm during the whole interaction but tried to take her baby back, but eventually relented and went back to her room while I changed the baby. By the end of it all, I realized that I was just overreacting. At least, in terms of the baby, as it wasn't like she had been crying and put two and two together and figured the baby had probably just made a mess and it wasn't his wife's fault. However, there was definitely no excusing the neglected dog. I went into her room with the baby and apologized, telling her I knew she was a good mom and that I was sorry for attempting to take her baby, that I knew she would never forgive me if I had taken her. His wife told me it was alright, that the reason why she didn't fight so hard is because she knew I would make the right decision. She then told me, for whatever reason, that if I wanted from now on I could come and fold her laundry and she's pay me $1.75 every time I did her laundry. I told her no thanks and was planning to leave with the dog.",hero
"I dreamt that it was night. I was sitting on the passenger side of a vehicle that was parked in front of a house that was recently purchased by someone I knew in my dream. It appeared to be a really nice move-in ready home, however, upon close examination, I could tell that the home was not habitable. The roof was incomplete as I could still see its trusses. It was evident that the home had been assembled quickly without regard. There was a non-occupant vehicle parked next to the vehicle that I was in. Despite the vehicle being new, there were visible scratches. Suddenly, the vehicle that I was in started to roll backwards. I struggled to stop the vehicle, but managed to figure it just moments prior to it rolling in the street . The vehicle's interior was quiet unique, and not at all what I am accustomed to. I couldn't figure out how to drive the vehicle forward towards the house. My husband came along to explain a few things about the vehicle. The dream changed and I was now sitting in the rear. There was a woman sitting in the driver's seat. Without warning the woman transformed into a dark green lizard. I was so frightened that I ran out of the vehicle. I started swimming through the air (a common occurrence in my dreams). Afraid that someone would see me, I sought-after a place that I could swim through the air without being seen.",everyman
"My late husband just screaming bad names at me and is very upset. There is not any violence just a screaming match and I just stand there and take it. In another one, we were out at a park and he was there with someone else and I told him he needed to choose and he chose the other person. Which then led to me screaming at him. One of the things I said was she is only 24! How could you? Then I told him I was going to take everything and I meant everything and then he was like just leave me now. I have had multiple dreams of him having other partners but none ended with him telling me to go. ;  Background_Info: I have had multiple dreams of my late husband.

"The dream was that a significantly older man was chasing after me and wanted to perform unwanted sexual acts on me. It was quite disturbing. On Friday night though, as I was running away, I moved into another dream where I was running down a stone cavernous hallway. I'm running away from something but I'm not sure what. I keep coming to wooden doors with ironwork designs on them and unlocking them with my old fashioned, black iron key. From around the right corner, before I run to each door, there is a woman with dark hair and eyes in a pink dress towing a mule on a rope. She walks around the corner before I run down the hallway where each door is so I see her 3 or 4 times as if I'm running down the same hallways again 4 times. I never look to see if she is coming from somewhere so I don't know if there is actually a corridor she's coming from. Eventually, I run through one of the doors and there was a white field. I hear a voice behind me and it's a futuristic-looking boy of about 18 (picture cyberpunk goggles and dystopian future-looking clothing). He says something and before I can hear it, I realize I'm dreaming, wake up and I ask him, ""What are you doing here? Who are you? Why am I having this dream and what and I supposed to learn?"" He smiles coyly and says I can only learn that if I promise I'm still dreaming. I say yes and he leads me back around to where I previously saw the next wooden door in the fully white field, but now there is cobblestone and an old town. I've been here before but only during summer when he place looked like a mystical campground. Now it looks dark, cold and snowy. All the people are silhouettes and faceless. The boy leads me around the block and speaks but I can't really hear him. I'm more focused on the silhouette people (if you've seen inception, the people moved in a similar way except they were only shadows). There was also nobody in the houses. As we round the second last corner of the block, I tell the boy I changed my mind and that I want to go through the wooden door instead. He asks if I'm sure and when I say yes, I suddenly become quite cartoonish and dive through the wooden door like a superhero. My brother and I not fly through space as I chose the video game as if we are at a starting screen. I choose a game called SMASH and play as a miniature gorilla with veins all over its body except this character is MY body in the same way that Ready Player One works.

"I was walking down a well worn road in the forest with a preacher I had frequently listened to in my youth.(was formerly very religious) The man was passionately defending the sincerity of his religious convictions in light of adopting more progressive religious views(theistic evolution). We then somehow climbed a boulder and sat on the top. The man tearfully explained the core of his religious convictions: ""the light of Christ in him"". I assured him that despite our religious disagreements, his passionate faith in Christ was evident. The man then started to slip down the boulder, and I grabbed him. I had a sense that he didn't want to be rescued, and indeed, he eventually fell. I also had a strong sense that my mother was almost comatosely observing the struggle. That added to my motivation to not let the man fall. When he did, my first instinct was to grab help, but, figured to check on him. I check on my mother first, to see how the scene had affected her.

"First, a scene involving a pedal bike, in working order though slightly haphazard condition, the chain nearly came off but didn't, oil was needed, vegetable oil was suggested. Next, my dad was fiddling with a newly rewired, large electrical box he'd constructed. I made a statement of it being 'the most complex for a simple operation', my dad replied that it was all good except 'occasionally doesn't work' at all. This I think was set in my childhood home, which has a workshop/studio room. Either my dad or myself commented on a cover of a plug socket being rather dirty, but on closer inspection the clear plastic cover which was semi translucent wasn't because it was dirty, but because it was the type of plastic which was glow in the dark when charged up by placing it near light first. For a good deal of time I was wandering around trying to find a light bulb to hold this piece of plastic near to see it glow, I never was able to find one. As I did, the small workshop room became a vast room the size of a large field with many people spread around the far perimeters engaged in a variety of very different activities.

My mouth feels uncomfortable and I retrieve a selection of small brown beads threaded onto on strings from my mouth. My mum makes jewelry in real life, though unlike these beads, I say 'i haven't even seen these ones before'. A sour faced woman appeared and takes her place where I was sitting, I make a joking comment to the effect of it being okay for me to have stolen her place. She sits down, I stand beside the table. I look off to the side and see through the hedge a set of decorative stone stairs which look like an ancient oriental entrance to a temple. Then an oriental spiritual master of some sort with a dead pan expression arrives at the table and sits at the head. Then, outside again, in some different place, a town in England.. I look at a wall leading along the side of an alley which led to an opening to a street below, it has a sign pinned on part of it with some words I forget now. As I look at it it was like a sped up timelapse occurred and the sign weathered away, deteriorated, became illegible and disappeared. The passageway beside that wall then got covered over by buildings, I sensed the route/passage had been moved to the right somewhat, like I'd witnessed the development of a town layout change over time. I then find myself stood nearby beside my sister, still atop the slight hill in a town, I was standing in a slightly puffed up imposing way, again aware of beads in my mouth, fetching a few more up. Some people walked by, I recognised the voice of a rapper who I listened to years ago, he was rhyming aloud, I felt my mood change from my fake imposing demeanor to a happy interested one, the rapper walked on around the corner, and one of his crew, a tall guy said I should call him and get in touch.",jester

The next day I was in my living room and noticed water damage coming through all of the walls/ceiling (some context last year we had some water leaks and it left our house cut open for the better part of 8 months waiting for contractors that in itself was a nightmare) as I looked closer at the walls I noticed they almost looked like they were molding or looked very old and cracking with scars on the walls, I looked up to the top left and there was a large, almost demonic alien full head/face imprinted in the wall, like as if the face was inside the wall pushing out. It had a very large cranium and smaller mouth comparable to an alien, this shit was scary looking. To my wife I said wtf is that! I then noticed halloweeny decorations all around the house and at that point I lost it and said babe did you put these decorations up?? She said no. All of a sudden a giant owl flew smacking straight into the window glass with force, I immediately ran outside to find I was in a cul de sac and the owl was hanging in front of the window connected to a long clothes line that was attached to a home across the street. I was so pissed and as I walk up to the house, the same people from the dream before came out with masks holding swords and approached me, I was able to disarm a sword from one of the three men, this time I didn’t recognize any of them. I realized the swords were wooden, then I remember waking myself up yelling we need to lock the doors. ;  Background_Info: This is two separate dreams, 2 days in a row. ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###",jester
"Last night I dreamt that he was back, I was a kid again, and all my family was together looking for a house and trying to start “a new life”, everything was the way it was before he died. All my family, brother, mom, dad, grandpa and grandpa, aunts etc was sitting around a table, eating dinner. Then I “woke up”, and I was all alone by the table. So I woke up from a dream, in my dream. And I started crying and looking for my family, and I said over and over “it’s too much, I can’t take this anymore”. ;  Background_Info:  I have had so many sad dreams for about a year. Crying and screaming in my sleep, + it freaks my bf out. My dad committed suicide 12 years ago, I was 11 at the time. I had a tough time dealing with it for many years, but I’ve been working on letting go and move on for about 3 years. The dreams are very different, but it’s always the same pattern: my dad comes back for a day, week, month, and he totally ignores me. I try to talk to him but he just pushed me away and talk to everyone else. Then when it’s time for him to go back to “heaven” (I’m not a religious person), he tells me he loves me and misses me, and that I have to move on. And then I scream and cry and wake up crying. ;  Wakeup_State:  and then I woke up crying. It feels like the more I’m working on moving on from my past, my dreams about family and dad gets worse.

"I walk into my house, to numerous cat poops on the floor, but they are all on fire. (Orange flames) But instead of putting out the fire, I walk past. I realize that there are also cat toys on fire too. There are two kittens, but it seems that everything they touch is becoming enflamed. One of the cats bats a toy my way and suddenly it’s on fire. One of the cats is playing under a coffee table and the toy/carpet is on fire so much it singes her fur! I grab the cat and cry because she’s singed but it doesn’t seem hurt then. I tell the other person the cats are setting things on fire, as they seem unaware. They snap back at me and then me: “it’s YOUR cat setting everything on fire!!!” I quickly realize that somehow they set a couch on fire, mainly the arm of the couch. The foam inside is smoldering. I run to get a bucket, but the first one is broken. The next one is full of dirty water, so I try and flush it down the toilet but it goes everywhere and the bucket proceeds to break too. I run to the kitchen to get a large cup just to slow the smoldering. But the water pressure is low and it’s taking forever. I fill the cup as much as I can and run to extinguish the fire. I keep going back for more water, and eventually find that the foam is smoldering near the floor, so I focus my attention there. Soon the foam reaches the floor/carpet and starts to set it on fire too. Now I’m aiming at the floor, as the smoldering has turned to actual fire. The floor becomes completely engulfed in flames and I can’t do anything except watch the flames crawl across the floor and up the wall.",hero

"I was in a dim indoor setting, with Indian decor. An Indian woman in traditional clothing was beside me. She held a candle and placed it on a table nearby. She handed me a candle, but I think I struggled a little to place it where I intended, on the table, she may have then handed me another, repeating this part... I moved into a side corridor, and a moment later, I was looking down from above at a small seeming elephant. There was another creature, almost as large, the elephant was over the top of it. The other creature was strange, it was white and appeared to have several legs, which were like large white upturned claws, like a huge claw-legged spider type creature on its back. The elephant stood over it, and crouched down with the other creature beneath it, as though it were gathering it, hugging it, enclosing it, bound within it's four legs. I saw a couple of the white claws that had found a gap between the elephants legs, and were extending reaching out and around the elephants back, the rest of the white clawed creature was obscured underneath the elephants body, with the elephants 4 legs confining the creature between them. Though the claws of the creature looked dangerous, it didn't harm the elephant. As the elephant then walked away, a few small illuminated spots of neon colour glowed briefly on the elephants body, as though the elephant had attained some special quality by doing so.

I freeze, hoping she and the cub will just move on. Slowly I hunker down into the bedding I've gathered up in the kitchen area. The lioness approaches me and sniffs my belly. I slowly curl into a ball on the bedding, sensing that I'm in a life or death situation. The lioness yawns and lays right over the top of me. I instantly find myself feeling warm, nested, and comfortable-\-\safe for now.

"I saw three planets and three tribes, I saw that these planets were beautiful and had all forms of life. On each planet, there were a tribe of people. Not all of them human. All of them were nomads, each traveling the planet they existed on. The first tribe wore brown leather clothing. This tribe’s king whilst leading his tribe lifted a scepter of gold in the air and proclaimed “I AM ONE KING, BUT TO ALL!” The planet they were on had a bright blue tint and the stars shown brightly. The second tribe were a tribe of alien, yet humanoid people. The Queen of this tribe lifted a spear into the air and proclaimed “I AM ONE QUEEN, BUT TO ALL!” This planet was the same as the other, only because it was night time. The third tribe were a tribe of creatures. Each person was a different shape and a different creature. One of the creatures, one of the few standing on two legs, lifted a scepter and proclaimed “I AM ONE KING, BUT TO ALL!” The planet here had a purple hue and the stars were pink. In each scenario, the dream focused more on the beauty of the world around me than the actual creatures and humans themselves. Though small details were still a bit visible. The dream then focused on a man, he was wizened and old. Long hair and a grown beard, brown hair color. He was walking around a stone table that had the locations of these planets upon it. The man was pacing and looked at a small spot north west to the table. The area was blocked off by a small stone fence. A face appeared as a spirit and it was beautiful.

Each floor was very small, painted lavender, and there were maybe about seven stories. Like my own personal tower. The rooms were full of furniture from the previous owner. It started off amazing. Me, my mother (my mother lives in another country) and my best friend and her husband were cleaning the place out. I was keeping the furniture I did want, giving away others. One the rooms was a children’s room, with a small bed and a crib, both made of golden coloured metal. I gave the crib to my friend, as in my dream she was either newly pregnant or trying for a baby. As we were emptying that room, someone got a call that a local boy had been kicked out of his house by his awful father. We all knew of him. I told her to tell the kid he could stay here, in this room until he could go home or figure something out. The boy never showed up in the dream, but somewhere around that conversation is when things started to go wrong. My friend took a shower and saw someone looking at her from the drain. We checked every drain, and every drain in the house had someone looking through it. Like all you could see was the eyeball, looking up.

"I am in an underground activity, like an escape room but on a larger scale, like a labyrinth. There are lots of people walking around trying to find the way out, but getting nowhere. One of them is an old dancing partner when I was taking ballroom dancing lessons. I get the impression of a long time searching for the proper path. The focus of the dream is when I come to an old temple, Ancient Greek-ish with a large granite statue, specifically granite with a rustic pinkish hue. Looking up into the temple roof I realise no one is up there and it dawns on me that the path is likely up there as no one down here has found the way, so I head up there. The dream then goes to an out of body view of the path. There is an above ground bridge like structure, and the way corkscrews as a tunnel around it. Because its a tunnel everyone assumes its underground, but it isn't, its not logical. That's the trick.",explorer

"I was at a beach, and there was an odd looking vehicle a bit like a tractor with its large back wheels, except this vehicle had no visible wheels at the front, and even larger rear wheels. I was aware that it was once above the sea level, on the sandy banks of the beach, but time had passed and I then witnessed it submerged just below the surface of the sea. I saw some people disappear below the water level and apparently get into the cabin, when it then rapidly, with unusual speed power and ease, reversed out of where it was submerged sunken in the sand offshore, back up onto the high sandy banks of the beach. Then this event was set back in time, ready to replay again, only with myself as an active participant in it, needing to prepare to do what I'd seen the people do - get into the cabin, and get the vehicle back out the sea onto the steep, sandy banks of the beach. There were a couple of odd scenes that were never seen or featured when I witnessed the first overview of events initially, I had a one half of a plastic clip like that found on a backpack or luggage (pictured), partly broken, which was presumably attached to the vehicle at one end, that I connected to the other half of the clip presumably attached to the sandy bank, one of the actual plastic clips was broken but I connected it to the other half precariously. I recall mentioning how seemingly ridiculous this feeble link was for the job at hand. Then, equally absurdly, I was handling some thin string which again might've been attached to the clip, which I was threading onto something fixed on the bank on the beach. Then was a sense of time urgency, and I along with a few others were standing atop the steep sandy banks of the beach, preparing to head to the sunken vehicle, submerge ourselves in the cold ocean and enter the cabin before getting the vehicle out from beneath the sea, where it was stuck deep into the sand, submerged. We were putting on wetsuits. I asked another ""do I need to take my top off?"" before putting on the wetsuit, ""yes"". Putting my arm into the sleeve of the suit I noticed just how thick the material was, several inches thick, enough to keep me from being shocked from the cold ocean temperature, so thick I might not even notice the temperature change at all.",explorer
"I was at my ex bfs house “we split in real life 1.5 years ago, I had to leave because of DV” so in my dream I was at his house but it was mine. I think I was in school had to study or something.

I saw him do a flip, so I tried one but I immediately fell to the ground because I was to fat. He told me to fly better I had to lose some weight. I then proceeded to fly around. I flew to the neighbors and started swinging one arm on a tree and they where shocked I could fly. I told him I got the vaccine moderna shot and if he got it to he may also be able to fly.

I took them back to her and freaked out on her yelling. Her and her friends started looking for the shoe. It was taking forever; she got in my face and I told her to get out of my face or I would fight her. She didn’t so I punched her but it was a slow punch, I hit her face where her glasses where and didn’t think it hurt her but she said OWE and started crying. We where all of a sudden in her sober house and I was talking a bunch of smack to her and her friends calling them low life’s.

Started crying n i stoped walking n put him on a seat standing so i can get more lved with him n i ask ""whats wrong?"" As i was thinking - how can you be in a place like this and be crying(because we were surrounded by tall trees and wilderness area where we lived in the town) - i asked 2 times before he answered, the first time he didnt want to say like his parents never wanted to hear him out n he looks down. I lift his chin up softly ""hey hey hey. . . look at me . . please"" i say softly and he looks at me n i let his chin go. ""What is wrong? Whats making you so upset? I really want to know"" I ask as we looked each other in the eyes. He seamed to calm down and says in a little bit of a whine ""Its boarding here and theres nothing to do. Its always the same"" i give a moment of silence before responding ""Ok how about this, when were done here i will play with you, anything you want. How about that?"" I asked n smiled being very caring about what i say which match my energy. ""Mhumm"" the kid responds with nodding.

So I dreamed that I was at my sons school and it felt so real…. As I was looking for my car with my unborn baby in my arms I look up and see it and see my dead grandmother and currently alive uncle but he looked dead both looked like corpses on the backseat I freaked out and look down and my baby disappears I ran to the car and the baby is in there moving around so I get in the car and try to get home but it leads me towards my old road to my grandmothers house across the state I pumped the breaks and do a u turn and try to get back home but more roads keep appearing and I panic and end up crashing the car so I get my stroller and baby and start walking but the closer I get to a building the farther away it goes and I can’t make it.

"In said dream I was part of some unit made up of child soldiers (except I wasn’t child, the others were) called the “F.S.W unit” or something like that, where all the kids line up and start filing in to this platform in the middle of a huge arena where there’s crowds all around watching, and once they get to the platform it’s like Russian roulette where there’s a 50/50 chance that a few will end up dying. The way they end up dying is that Chucky (you know, the creepy doll) runs around underneath the platform with his hand out, grabbing the kid’s hands, and if the kid squeezes his hand back then he sentences them to death by chasing after them with a huge knife. I eventually caught onto this, so I stopped squeezing his little hand whenever he’d put it out and he was like “fucksakes, this bitch is gonna be a tricky one” or something (sorry for the language). Then I had a military uniform on and gear and had to crawl/run really fast throughout a series of tunnels that my bedroom was connected to in order to get away. Then my boyfriend was there, but can’t really remember what he was doing. I was sitting in fetus position up against a wall with all my stuff on and I just remember him bending down in front of me and saying something, but I had PTSD and was confused.

Later in the dream, I met another beautiful woman, also my age, who also really liked me. This made the situation difficult, since I had to decide which one to hurt. It wasn't a pleasant choice. In the end, I chose the second woman.  Now, I associate these women with my anima. What does anyone here think about this? Does this indicate some kind of ""split?"" Another detail is that the first woman had dark hair, and the second woman had light hair. Normally, I find dark-haired women more attractive, yet I chose the light-haired one. What do you all think? Why would I have to choose to hurt one? Is this related to my recent re-connection?  Later in the dream, I found myself next to a well. A man standing there said that it was pretty cold.

"The first part consists of me riding in a misty morning on an empty lengthy road in between wetlands with leafless trees. Nothing crazy. The second part happens the next day, where my father told me to get to my hometown using his car. For some unknown reason, I am riding above our river that for some reason has multiple bridges that I am passing below me. Few times I fall down to the river (luckily it is not so deep) and I remember that father liked to get me into situations that are not pleasant for the sake of being more manly. I felt scared and used. Nonetheless, I end up in my hometown next to a mountain (that is not there, we only have a small hill) I climb it up and for some reason, I have a hovering sofa above my shoulders ( It sounds stupid, but it was there) I climb up that hill and at the top, I even climb up our cemetery. and there I meet a nice girl. I strike up a conversation trying to get to know her, but somehow I am failing and becoming anxious. I see myself grinning uncertainly, and I fail to get her contact. She even had a dog and for some reason, I had her pictures with the dog on my phone. Kinda creepy. It is getting late and I just arrived at my friend's house under a bridge we have in our hometown. I don't know why, but in my dreams, there is a small town there. Yet in reality, there is just a downwards path. I am charging my phone there and she is not around, I feel like I should not be there and the sofa is normally placed in her house. I tried calling her, but she did not answer. Suddenly I am in school with my great friend and we are goofing around. Suddenly I look at the pictures on my phone, where I see me, my friend, and a girl I fell in love last year. I thought it was weird since I deleted all of them and on one photo she seems genuinely sad/happy and I know that I am the reason. And the last part. Its night and I am next to the cemetery with my cousin whom I admire deeply. He is innocently poking fun at my choices in women. He calls them "" Girl with a tattoo, Girl with dreadlocks, now a girl with a dog"" After that we look at a star on a grave beyond the cemetery wall. He makes a joke that does not make sense in any way. To which I respond smugly, yeah my brother already did that joke. And suddenly we hear heavy scratching sounds that are approaching us. He says it is a wolf, and that we should run before he sees us, he runs behind the wall of the cemetery, while I try to climb it up (these walls are smaller than me).

"The dream was that a significantly older man was chasing after me and wanted to perform unwanted sexual acts on me. It was quite disturbing. On Friday night though, as I was running away, I moved into another dream where I was running down a stone cavernous hallway. I'm running away from something but I'm not sure what. I keep coming to wooden doors with ironwork designs on them and unlocking them with my old fashioned, black iron key. From around the right corner, before I run to each door, there is a woman with dark hair and eyes in a pink dress towing a mule on a rope. She walks around the corner before I run down the hallway where each door is so I see her 3 or 4 times as if I'm running down the same hallways again 4 times. I never look to see if she is coming from somewhere so I don't know if there is actually a corridor she's coming from. Eventually, I run through one of the doors and there was a white field. I hear a voice behind me and it's a futuristic-looking boy of about 18 (picture cyberpunk goggles and dystopian future-looking clothing). He says something and before I can hear it, I realize I'm dreaming, wake up and I ask him, ""What are you doing here? Who are you? Why am I having this dream and what and I supposed to learn?"" He smiles coyly and says I can only learn that if I promise I'm still dreaming. I say yes and he leads me back around to where I previously saw the next wooden door in the fully white field, but now there is cobblestone and an old town. I've been here before but only during summer when he place looked like a mystical campground. Now it looks dark, cold and snowy. All the people are silhouettes and faceless. The boy leads me around the block and speaks but I can't really hear him. I'm more focused on the silhouette people (if you've seen inception, the people moved in a similar way except they were only shadows). There was also nobody in the houses. As we round the second last corner of the block, I tell the boy I changed my mind and that I want to go through the wooden door instead. He asks if I'm sure and when I say yes, I suddenly become quite cartoonish and dive through the wooden door like a superhero. My brother and I not fly through space as I chose the video game as if we are at a starting screen. I choose a game called SMASH and play as a miniature gorilla with veins all over its body except this character is MY body in the same way that Ready Player One works.

"I was at some kind of ceremony that I had a good amount of contempt for. We were very shoddily acting out a re-enactment of something. I remember having a vague idea of what I was supposed to be doing, but everything was screwed up. My contribution was the furthest off from the ideal, but it everyone else seemed content with the proceedings. Something significant was supposed to happen in the ceremony but a car crash or another kind of emergency outside made everyone focus on that instead. However, while everyone was busying themselves with that I noticed a small, almost imperceptible scratch on my the end of my ring finger (I cant remember which hand). I started to squeeze it and puss started to come out. It wasn't painful, in fact it was pretty relieving to have it come out. It was kind of off-white or greenish initially, but as I kept squeezing it, eventually it turned into red, kind of like clotted blood. It didn't take long before I got all of the hardened stuff out of my finger and I as I did so I had garnered a fair amount of ""eww""s and ""yuck""s and ""doesnt that hurt?"" To which I responded ""not really. My body needs to get rid of it."" Having felt I got it all out I looked up again and everything seemed different.

I didn't understand why he was trying to attack he as I barely knew him. I ran out the apartment building as he tried to get me, but a guy sitting nearby came and rescued me. I noticed his bald head and big beard, and thought that it wasn't a style I liked on men but it didn't matter as he was helping me.

"The dream was that a significantly older man was chasing after me and wanted to perform unwanted sexual acts on me. It was quite disturbing. On Friday night though, as I was running away, I moved into another dream where I was running down a stone cavernous hallway. I'm running away from something but I'm not sure what. I keep coming to wooden doors with ironwork designs on them and unlocking them with my old fashioned, black iron key. From around the right corner, before I run to each door, there is a woman with dark hair and eyes in a pink dress towing a mule on a rope. She walks around the corner before I run down the hallway where each door is so I see her 3 or 4 times as if I'm running down the same hallways again 4 times. I never look to see if she is coming from somewhere so I don't know if there is actually a corridor she's coming from. Eventually, I run through one of the doors and there was a white field. I hear a voice behind me and it's a futuristic-looking boy of about 18 (picture cyberpunk goggles and dystopian future-looking clothing).

"I was at a beach, and there was an odd looking vehicle a bit like a tractor with its large back wheels, except this vehicle had no visible wheels at the front, and even larger rear wheels. I was aware that it was once above the sea level, on the sandy banks of the beach, but time had passed and I then witnessed it submerged just below the surface of the sea. I saw some people disappear below the water level and apparently get into the cabin, when it then rapidly, with unusual speed power and ease, reversed out of where it was submerged sunken in the sand offshore, back up onto the high sandy banks of the beach. Then this event was set back in time, ready to replay again, only with myself as an active participant in it, needing to prepare to do what I'd seen the people do - get into the cabin, and get the vehicle back out the sea onto the steep, sandy banks of the beach. There were a couple of odd scenes that were never seen or featured when I witnessed the first overview of events initially, I had a one half of a plastic clip like that found on a backpack or luggage (pictured), partly broken, which was presumably attached to the vehicle at one end, that I connected to the other half of the clip presumably attached to the sandy bank, one of the actual plastic clips was broken but I connected it to the other half precariously. I recall mentioning how seemingly ridiculous this feeble link was for the job at hand. Then, equally absurdly, I was handling some thin string which again might've been attached to the clip, which I was threading onto something fixed on the bank on the beach.

We were putting on wetsuits. I asked another ""do I need to take my top off?"" before putting on the wetsuit, ""yes"".

It quite literally felt like someone had hacked my brain with an extremely realistic and vivid video that was being broadcast; it almost felt like a subliminal message being flashed quickly.

Nobody knows about coffee tea and I start a trend pointing out that it’s a cool place to hang and chill so all of a sudden a lot of people are there and it’s still just like a normal occasion type of feeling. I meet this dude named chip who is actually a guy I knew much later in my life who was in a band, very talented but not famous just local cool guys in a local ska band, in the dream it’s when he’s 15 years old, same age as Eddie Veddar in this dream. I didn’t know him in real life at that age. I have weed and I tell him we’ll hang out. We hit it off like we always did in real life. There’s a band playing that is basic and blah and im hanging out with a whole group at a table. Just kids and Eddie veddar is just one of the guys in our crew obviously not important yet except to me since I knew the future. I keep talking to him about his life. I tried writing it down for him to keep, but in the dream I can’t seem to get my hand to write letters. He has like a friend/brother who’s not interested wearing a mask like today except in the dream it’s not for Covid it’s just a fashion statement, but Eddie is interested in talking. We keep talking. I keep getting jumped by this really pissed off group of guys with one dude in it who is very skittish... he’s the one who mocks sticking a shiv in my neck to let me know that could’ve been real and if I don’t confirm, next time it will be real. I escape through a small service window and That one skittish guy follows me outside where it’s just us so I get a little more brave and start boxing him. Except in the dream I can’t seem to throw an actual punch it’s slow motion no impact. But he compliments my left hook and starts being complimentary in submissive psychopathic way.",everyman

After buying the milk and losing my friend from the mall (since she also have errands to do), i quickly lined up on this another store and asked them to clean the bottle of the milk and scan the beverage for its ingredients or content. Suddenly, this friend of mine also popped up in this store and this time i have the feeling that she's suspicious of the milk's content too. Apparently when the lady that scanned the milk came back, she said that it's 90% milk content so, I quickly reasoned myself out to my friend and said that I just wanted to get the bottle cleaned but deep inside, I still doubt this and thought that I'll just throw it out once im home. After exiting the mall and while walking down the street, i sensed this one man looking suspiciously at us. I grabbed my friend's hand and pulled her to walk faster and exit these streets but more numbers of men got up and chased us. We continuously ran until we reached this street where another group of men is waiting for us. And this time, I couldn't pull my friend to run anymore, she just stopped and stared at them this time.",rebel

"I was at some kind of archeological dig. The man leading the dig had a daughter, a beautiful woman about my age, and after playing hard to get, she decided she really liked me. Later in the dream, I met another beautiful woman, also my age, who also really liked me. This made the situation difficult, since I had to decide which one to hurt. It wasn't a pleasant choice. In the end, I chose the second woman.  Now, I associate these women with my anima. What does anyone here think about this? Does this indicate some kind of ""split?"" Another detail is that the first woman had dark hair, and the second woman had light hair. Normally, I find dark-haired women more attractive, yet I chose the light-haired one. What do you all think? Why would I have to choose to hurt one? Is this related to my recent re-connection?  Later in the dream, I found myself next to a well. A man standing there said that it was pretty cold. Even though it was cold in my room as I was sleeping, in the dream, I suddenly felt hot. I looked down into the well, and saw ice floating in the water there.

Grandmother has died, and this is either my inheritance, or things that were already mine but kept in her house. My parents are packing up and sorting things in other parts of the house. When my father asks me if I am ready to leave, I ask for more time. He takes note of my short black skirt and asks if it is new. I answer that it is. All of my clothing is black, possibly because I am in mourning. He then goes off to some other part of the house to continue his sorting.

I adjust my thick black stockings, pulling them up over my knees, more for warmth than anything else.

I was visited by a man my age whom I don't know in real life, he seemed to be sort of a partner to be. When he left I was visited by yet another man, my ex partner. I don't recall if there was any conversation but the spirits were high and there was also no sense of distress to the situation, it was like meeting an old friend that you still hold a lot of affection for because you simply like the person.

I was surprised but nowhere near in a state in which I would be if this happened to me in real life. Trust me, I like my face the way it is. In the dream the feeling was that of curiosity. I looked inside my head and there to the right I found two pieces of some type of long, beige, spongy material. I was under the impression that I had undergone a brain surgery and the pieces were there to hold the hemisphere in place.

I'm an evil man (woman in real life btw which is interesting as well), a criminal. I drive fast and recklessly and I’m running through several doors, up and down stairs….Soon I've gotten rid of the cops, they're not after me anymore.

We are hanging on iron pillars and fencing. I get a hold of his sword and I kick him off the building, I watch him fall while I hang there. When he hits the ground I look up at the building, there I see millions of faces / heads on the building - like manikin heads.

We went to the grocery store and went to get haircuts and buy clothes but we only got to the shops half an hour before they closed but the staff let us stay in this store past closing and we chatted with them.

I left it on the side of the road and throughout the day I went back and forth to it. The last time I went out to it, it was empty and I felt really sad about my things being stolen.

"I am in an underground activity, like an escape room but on a larger scale, like a labyrinth. There are lots of people walking around trying to find the way out, but getting nowhere. One of them is an old dancing partner when I was taking ballroom dancing lessons. I get the impression of a long time searching for the proper path. The focus of the dream is when I come to an old temple, Ancient Greek-ish with a large granite statue, specifically granite with a rustic pinkish hue. Looking up into the temple roof I realise no one is up there and it dawns on me that the path is likely up there as no one down here has found the way, so I head up there. The dream then goes to an out of body view of the path. There is an above ground bridge like structure, and the way corkscrews as a tunnel around it. Because its a tunnel everyone assumes its underground, but it isn't, its not logical. That's the trick.",explorer

I finally found him and he was just standing there smiling at me. I ran up to him and told him I was sorry about the loss of his brother and he didn't say a word he just kept smiling. I went to hug him and it was one of those really long hugs that you don't want to end. ;  Background_Info: Years ago after I split up with my son's father I started seeing a man named Earl. We had a really good time together. I really liked him. He had problems though and he drank way too much. He would get sloppy drunk almost every day. So I had to break it off with him. I didn't want to but I couldn't help him and at the time I had a 3 year old to care for that didn't need to be around a falling down drunk. It broke his heart when I ended things. He blew my phone up for over a week begging me for another chance. I stood my ground and kept telling him no. One evening my son and I were at a friend's house when he showed up crying drunk still begging me. I was annoyed so I grabbed my son and we went home and went to bed.  ;  Wakeup_State: Then I woke up.

"The sense of place has a strange feel to it despite the mundane descriptions. I'm in a city, I experience being aboard something like a stationary train or tram, I'm lacking a requirement to travel back on the train, I think I wish to buy a piece of cake before my return journey for some reason, but I'm trying to fish out my payment card and ID card and making other passengers wait, I see my bags on the floor unzipped, my belongings bulging out of them in an unorganized fashion as I fish around on my person for my cards, I feel the passengers impatience with me. Then I'm standing in something approximating a shopping mall, apparently attempting a different route of travel, standing in front of a phone with old fashioned handset in my hand like those of old phone boxes. I lift up the handset a couple of times, the unusual looking digital screen flickers slightly but fails to spring to life, I lift it a third time and the phone and display then connects successfully. I speak in a slightly shakey voice, stating that I wish to attain something, perhaps this cake I'm after by relaying my card details, to then travel back by alternative means, perhaps by car, and the natural sounding voice I recognize as artificial intelligence identifies by the sound of my voice that I am somehow unfit, as though drunk and intending to drive, only not that, and manages to deduce I'm breaching some rule in what I am asking, recognizing I must be traveling back by a method I'm unfit to do in this circumstance, based upon my request. I'm then elsewhere walking on some dim grey street, having traveled another different route, I see a person walking in front of me, I recognize them as a second instance of an identical person I've just seen at the opposite end of the road I'm walking down, beyond them I see an oddly distinct looking vehicle drive around the corner of a road, at that moment another identical vehicle drives around the same corner in the opposite direction. Then I find myself at a different scene, looking at a damaged, blackened decrepit shell of a helicopter leaning towards the edge of a small muddy pit of water beside it. I pan my head right and there is a small glass cubicle, like the glass cockpit of a crane or digger, with a man sat inside it. Beside him is a cake, he asks me what size slice I'd like, I gesture with my finger and thumb the thickness, but my hand is shakey, I worry this looks suspect somehow, I hold my hand with my other hand to steady it, struggling to indicate a sufficient thickness of slice. He serves me a slice of cake within two slices of bread, like a sandwich with some salad in it also. A bit odd, I thought. I took a bite, I sense the cool temperature of the salad. I ask the person that served me the cake 'what month were you born in?' as if to inquire his relatedness to me, as one might enquire to infer anothers zodiac sign. He says 'I was born in such-and-such a year', (I forget the actual year) clearly failing to understand the concept of a month, answering like a somewhat poorly programmed artificial intelligence humanoid.

(There's a kid with me and I forget who else.) I trying to hide in different places but never find one satisfactory. I try stuffing myself, slat by slat between the wooden slats under the bed and the mattress, but this actually feels very exposed and like the wood might snap, attracting dinosaur. I wanted to be wrapped up in several several blankets and have boxes and things stacked in front of me in a closet, or hide my face amongst stuffed animals like an E.T., but all this moving is making noise and there isn’t adequate stuff to cover me. I'm making noise and time is running out. For all I know I'm attracting the things which are certainly killing people in this huge boarding house/hotel. I cross the hall and chance finding a hiding spot in another room, when I decide on a real solution and slip outside the window and I'm standing on winging bricks that wrap around the building like in a Hitchcock movie. I remember I've dreamed the same dream before and the raptors can scale and climb all over the outside of the building, too. But I don't see any. Finally I decide, screw this place, and run across the lawn toward traffic. Now my lovely friend is there with me and now a raptor is chasing us both. It seems obvious that the raptor is going to catch us, but she yells out that we've beat it before, like everything will be fine, and indeed we make it into traffic. I'm hoping it will be hit. We make it into a parked food truck, where men are working. The fear of raptor-pursuit is greatly reduced. I tell them to take me anywhere but there. Rebecca, on the other hand, confidently tells them to drop her right back off by the front of the lawn and confidently struts back toward the hotel.

She is wearing an old white dress, somewhat like what you see below. Having her stand there is making me uneasy, funnily enough. She doesn't look scary or anything, though. There is some sense that I can choose to acknowledge her presence or not - as if her presence is only a suggestion.I choose to do so, and I ask her who she is. She simply lifts her arm and points her finger at me. At this point I immediately think to ask if she is my Anima, and so I do. She says no, however, but for some reason I don't quite believe her. She might be telling the truth, though - i couldn't say. I think I went on to ask her some other questions as well, but I don't really remember any more. One of them might have been 'what are you doing here', to which I recall no answer. I'm not sure how you might even have answered that question though, seeing as it would make sense for her to be there, if she is really a part of me, just the same way it makes sense for me to be there.",jester

"I was going to the bathroom, and as I sit on the toilet (which I don't think has so much to say here - I think it's just that that is the angle from which I most commonly see the bathroom :P), I notice that there's a young girl (maybe 16 or so) standing in front of the shower in the other corner of the bathroom. She is wearing an old white dress, somewhat like what you see below. Having her stand there is making me uneasy, funnily enough. She doesn't look scary or anything, though. There is some sense that I can choose to acknowledge her presence or not - as if her presence is only a suggestion.I choose to do so, and I ask her who she is. She simply lifts her arm and points her finger at me. At this point I immediately think to ask if she is my Anima, and so I do. She says no, however, but for some reason I don't quite believe her. She might be telling the truth, though - i couldn't say. I think I went on to ask her some other questions as well, but I don't really remember any more. One of them might have been 'what are you doing here', to which I recall no answer. I'm not sure how you might even have answered that question though, seeing as it would make sense for her to be there, if she is really a part of me, just the same way it makes sense for me to be there.",jester

"I visit the town and I walk along the street with someone Idk (but do in this dream). I realise something is wrong and that all of the shops now have weird names. Still their names but either with a night/dream pun or some night/dream logo. The person idk (Let’s call him P, I guess) sat on a bench and I ask them wth is going on, they confirm it was my town but that it’s called Whoville now. Very confused, we walk into this shop. The manager is walking around shouting ‘Make sure […] don’t fall asleep in my shop!’. Some guy looks drunk and as if he’s going to fall asleep. P helps him out of the shop and he’s grateful. Soon after, the shops begin to close and the place looks dark and gloomy. All the shops looked as if they were abandoned. Broken windows, lights, and cafés had food laying around. People walking around went into different shops. A group of women were in this café next to me and began eating. Quickly, they all collapsed. P complains that this is just like ‘so and so shop’ and that people just shouldn’t take the risk anymore! I quickly realised that they were all dead. (For some reason) I and P break the windows of a real estate shop and see this very old, short man with black hair and small glasses. He wore old fashioned but fancy clothes. We talk to him for a bit, ask him questions etc. Turns out that you can either leave your shop in view or hide it. If you leave it in view you can leave a light on to let people know […].

As a kid, he and some townsfolk went down there (for some reason). All of a sudden, he found this girl around his age. She wore a gorgeous blue dress and bonnet with white trim. They talked and talked and they had a great time. The town and he all had to escape the cavern and he begged the girl to come. He dragged her up all the scaffolding with the town. Just as they reached the door back into the shop, part of the scaffolding was gone. The town (already on the other side) tried to help but there wasn’t much they could do. He held onto her and she begged him to leave her here and he jumped successfully to the door. He said ‘We made it!’. But then the girl, still in his arms, said that she wasn’t finished here yet and like a snake slithered out of his arms and fell back into the cavern. The man said that he had stayed there for years hoping to finally be able to save that girl. I and P both nodded toward each other and we went out the back door and began our climb down into the cavern, the man not far behind us. With our flashlights, we looked around for ages. Eventually, we found the girl who wore the same blue dress. The man was ecstatic and began to talk to her. All was well until all of a sudden she began to transform into this huge snake-like creature (with small legs and she was still wearing the dress). (I don’t remember why but) She began to attack us.

I dreamed of an infestation of wasps in my childhood home. Strangers who had no idea how many wasps were actually inside the house were trying to help handing me an array of flyswatters as if that could take care of the millions of wasps surrounding us.

"My sister got surgery to turn her tongue into a penis. We were sitting in the car me and her in the backseat while my husband was driving. I kept wondering if she can taste anything now since she doesn't have any taste buds. And also if she regrets it. because it's a life long alteration to her body. I for some reason said to her. I guess your transgender? And she said no she's still a girl. And then I agreed since I guess it's only her tongue.

"I had sliced 1-2 inch lines all over my body, slanting in random directions, and inserted fractions of leaves in each one. The idea was that this was important and should be done. I don't remember why. There was no blood or gore. Minimal pain. (I have been playing with an arrowhead and a plastic tablecloth the previous evening). The torn leaves were somewhat thinner than kaffir lime leaves. After they had set flat with my skin between its layers for some time, they were to be removed. And I started removing them by reopening the cuts, and using my fingernails to get a grip. I had removed them from my left side, when I took a break for some reason and thougt, ""I hope these don't heal into my right side"", though without real anxiety. There was nothing gory under the surface. Just slightly more intimate layers of skin. There was pain. I don't recall cutting or removing them from my neck or torso, but definitely my arms and legs.",everyman
I became passionate about a girl after noticing feminine power and depth inside her eyes. I experienced some things related to this and even saw signs and after inquiring further discovered her Sun sign is my moon sign and my sun is hers.

It’s unclear why but my mom volunteered to take some type of lethal pill. I didn’t realize what was going on, until it was too late. People were surrounding her as she lay in the middle of the floor, struggling to breathe. I came over and she told me to give my aunt a message from her before she’s gone.

"Part one: I enter a large stone building that is shaped sort of like an igloo. The building is completely empty but inside looks like it used to be a place of worship or church. At the back there’s a stairway leading up to what seemed to be a large wood stove or oven, that hasn’t been used in a while. I walked up the stairs to the stove to find that it had been converted to a shower and immediately felt that I needed to wash myself. I begin to take my clothes off and noticed that clothes from other people had been left behind. I also noticed that the showerhead had started to run and everyone else’s clothes were getting wet. I had no place to put my clothes down because there was water everywhere. In the dream I never did end up showering because the dream shifted to what seemed like a second part...Part two: Standing there with the water still running, I looked over and saw a television with a show playing. In the show there was a father, a mother, and a young adult son who lived out in the wilderness alone, possibly in some sort of post-apocalyptic situation.￼ The son had down syndrome. He had sunglasses that were broken, but his father was able to fix them for him and he was very appreciative to have his sunglasses back. The family was happy that the father was handy enough to fix the things that were broken in the family. But then the dream shifted to the mother. The family found out that she had a life-threatening condition of some kind, something to do with her brain. Possibly a brain injury of some kind. The father was working on a way to fix her, and his solution involved cutting away her consciousness and transplanting it into himself or some other Avatar so that she could continue living in another being. The son was very concerned about this, but the mother assured him that this was the only way for her to continue existing. The morbid piece was that the father would to have to perform the surgery on her with no sedation due to their circumstances, and the process was going to be torturous and agonizing for her. But she insisted they moved forward anyways. I think she died, but I cannot be sure. The dream ended here. ;  Background_Info: My stresses are through the roof these days.

"It started in the middle for me, I was in my room and a girl i went to school with little sister was there like sitting by a drain and she told me that she kept feeling something touch her through the drain and I look over and she’s not there anymore and I see them trying to grab a stuffed animal that was right beside her thinking it’s me or something and I hit their hand and I screamed, what did you do with, Izzy, but that’s not even her name. I’m freaking out because I’m thinking how much strength did they have to have to pull this little red headed girl through and drain, and how messed up her body was look now!

But I remembered seeing a white hand through the drain. So sense we live so close I tried to run to my house for safety and it was too late, my dad pull out his Glock the guy pulled out his gun and two shots were fired and I just shut my eye and I seen white, and it was like as if I felt the bullets as well but I just kept walking towards my house. I didn’t even look to see who had died I just went back to my room crying to my mom and my boyfriend and as I’m on the floor like hysterically crying I stand up and through the window I see the black male wrapped up (dead) and being put into like a police van. I distinctly remember after I seen his dead body in my head I went “I just seen a dead body”. I went into more of a shock and then more of a hysterical cry, and I remember my mom trying to get my grandma to come out and to calm me down, she gets to my house I head outside, and the last part before I woke I just remember sinking into her arms while falling on the prettiest, greenest grass I’ve ever seen.",hero
